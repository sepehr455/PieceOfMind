1.) Code indentation:
    <p>Make sure you are indenting your code properly to make it more readable. For specific indenting information and guidelines visit [This Website.](https://codehs.gitbooks.io/introcs/content/Programming-with-Karel/how-to-indent-your-code.html)</p>

2.) Commenting:
    <p>Commenting and documentation are essential parts of writing good code. It is important to note that too much commenting can fill up the code with a bunch of unnecessary info, causing a distraction for the reader.</p>

3.) Commit message:
    <p>Another essential key in keeping an organized environment is version control. Every single attempt to commit in GitLab must have a clear message attached to it, mentioning the exact details that have changed in the commitment.</p>

4.) Variable names 
    <p>Make sure you are choosing proper names for variables. The variable names should describe the usage of the variable to some extent for the reader to understand them. In case you are unable to use a proper name, you can add documentation to describe the usage of the variable</p>

5.) Method names: 
    <p>Similar to variable names, make sure that you are naming the methods such that the reader gets an idea of the functionality of the method and its use.</p>

6.) Pushing to git:
    <p>Once you feel ready to push the remote repository, make sure to push it to a personal branch. Then submit a merge request and the team can review your work and merge it to the master branch.</p>
